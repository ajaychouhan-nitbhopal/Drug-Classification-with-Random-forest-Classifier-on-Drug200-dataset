# Random Forest Classifier on Drug200 dataset

This is the code for "Random Forests Classifier" on drug200 dataset by Ajay Chouhan.

## Overview

This is the code of Random Forest Classifier which is implemented on Drug200 dataset.

Age, Sex, Blood Pressure, and Cholesterol of 200 patients are the features in this Classifier Model.

Classifier is built to find a proper drug for a new patient among 5 drugs (namely: drugA, drugB, drugC, drugX, and drugY).

Train set is of 150 patients and Test set is of 50 patients. Accuracy of 100 percent is achieved by using 100 no. of estimators.
